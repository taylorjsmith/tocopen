\futuresection{Closure Properties}\label{sec:closurepropertiesdecidable}

\begin{construction}
As with the previous chapters, I eventually plan to write a section summarizing the closure properties of various operations applied to the classes of decidable and semidecidable languages. Since Turing machines are so powerful, it's not surprising that nearly all operations are closed for both decidable and semidecidable languages, but it's worth explaining that semidecidable languages happen not to be closed under complement.
