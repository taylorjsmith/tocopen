\futuresection{Rice's Theorem}\label{sec:ricestheorem}

\begin{construction}
To close this chapter, I'll discuss Rice's theorem~\citeyearpar{Rice1953ClassesRecursivelyEnumerable}: a generalization of the halting problem that reveals every nontrivial semantic property of Turing machines is undecidable! Hopefully, by this point, the reader's hope will not have been totally wiped out before getting to later chapters.
